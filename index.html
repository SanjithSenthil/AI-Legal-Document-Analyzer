                        to hopefully better decisions than automatically clicking the accept button.

                        These could create problems in the future but it is not certain, so it depends on your opinion about the

                        Thus, FinePrint will also help in indicating the positives (hence, the green flags) of each company,
                        so you get to weigh the positives and the negatives. The decision is up to you!

                    <p>Our AI model uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) to analyse the uploaded document sentence by sentence, 
                        provide a summary, and categorise information into the three different categories that were mentioned
                        above: Red Flag, Yellow Flag, and Green Flag.

                    <p>The AI model was trained manually, using test data which consisted of sentences containing common clauses 
                        and keywords found in contracts; using sentences from each of our categories, we trained the model to 
                        accurately recognise and classify sentences.

                <p>Many social media sites like Instagram have reserved the right to publicly distribute, modify, or
                store any images you upload to their platforms.

                TwitPic, an image sharing platform previously on Twitter, also reserved the right to distribute your 
                pictures to any organisation they were affiliated with, meaning even if you delete your content, it is
                more than likely that your pictures still exist on the internet. In addition, TwitPic famously had a 
                deal with World Entertainment Celebrity News Network which stated any image uploaded to their site 
                could be sold and distributed by TwitPic without compensation or consent.

                <p>Skype is an example of a company who does not offer users the option to delete their accounts. On 
                    their  website, it ambiguously implies that there is an option to delete personal information, but 
                    it is not explicitly stated if all copies of this information are deleted from Skype servers.

                    without even thinking about it.

                    In particular, the terms and conditions of Facebook state that if you are logged into Facebook, Meta will track 
                    every website you visit which contains a Facebook “like” or “share” button, and tie this information to your name
                    and email address. If you are not logged in, information on sites you visit are assigned a code and associated
